Label Assignment:

Assign labels to your latent representations based on the coordinates. You can use a mapping of coordinates to states to do this. For example, if an image's coordinates fall within the boundaries of Texas, assign it the label 'Texas'.
Model Training:

Choose a suitable classifier that can handle the multi-class classification task. This could be a Support Vector Machine (SVM), a Random Forest classifier, a neural network, or any other appropriate algorithm.
Split your dataset into training and testing (validation) sets.
Train your model using the latent representations as input features and the state labels as targets.
Probability Estimation:

After training, use your model to predict the state for a new image by first obtaining its latent representation.
Ensure your model outputs a probability distribution over all states for each image. This is typically achieved by using a softmax layer in neural networks or by using probability calibration techniques for other types of classifiers.
